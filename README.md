# Automatic Fish Feeder Code - 2017
This code was used for a 2017 college mechatronics project where I designed and made a functioning automatic fish feeder for my tank, running Arduino.
This is a short video of the working system that was required for the course https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND-tekkcz7o
